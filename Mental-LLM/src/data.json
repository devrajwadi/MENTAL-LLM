      "description": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental health condition marked by persistent, intrusive thoughts known as obsessions and repetitive behaviors or mental acts called compulsions.\n\n Individuals with OCD feel compelled to perform these rituals in an attempt to alleviate the distress caused by their obsessions, even though these actions often provide only temporary relief and may not be logically connected to the feared outcome.\n\nOCD can significantly disrupt daily life, affecting personal relationships, work, and overall quality of life. Effective treatments typically involve a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), especially Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\n \nFew Symptoms of OCD which are noticed commonly are:-\n\n- Excessive concern about germs, dirt, or illness.\n- Extreme discomfort if objects are not aligned or symmetrical.\n- Repeatedly washing hands or cleaning surfaces.\n- Checking doors, locks, appliances, or personal belongings multiple times.\n- Performing tasks a specific number of times or counting objects.\n- Placing items in a particular order or symmetry."
